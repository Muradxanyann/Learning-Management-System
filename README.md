## Overview
This is a **Learning Management System (LMS)** pet project built with **ASP.NET Core 8**, designed to practice and demonstrate a full-stack backend architecture using **Onion Architecture** principles.

The project includes three main models:

- **Student** – represents a student entity
- **Course** – represents a course entity
- **Lesson** – represents a lesson inside a course

The project is fully layered:
- **Domain Layer** – entities and interfaces
- **Infrastructure Layer** – database context, migrations, repository implementations
- **Service Layer** – business logic and service interfaces
- **Presentation Layer** – API controllers (CRUD + Swagger)

---

## Features

- **CRUD operations** for Student, Course, and Lesson
- **DTOs** for request/response to avoid exposing EF Core entities
- **Swagger UI** for easy API testing
- **PostgreSQL** database integration with EF Core migrations
- **Onion Architecture** for clear separation of concerns
- **Async/await** for all database operations
- **Fluent API & Data Annotations** for EF Core model configuration
- **GUID primary keys** for all entities
- **Snake_case convention** for PostgreSQL compatibility

---

## Project Structure

The project follows **Onion Architecture** principles and is organized as follows:

- **Presentation/** – API layer
    - `Controllers/` – handles HTTP requests for Students, Courses, Lessons
    - `Program.cs` – application entry point and service registration

- **Service/** – Business logic layer
    - `Interfaces/` – service interfaces (e.g., IStudentService)
    - `Implementations/` – concrete service implementations

- **Domain/** – Core entities and interfaces
    - `Entities/` – Student, Course, Lesson models
    - `DTOs/` – request and response objects for API
    - `Exceptions/` – domain-specific exceptions
    - `Interfaces/` – repository or domain interfaces

- **Infrastructure/** – Database and persistence layer
    - `Persistence/` – EF Core DbContext, migrations, repository implementations
    - `Configurations/` – Fluent API configurations

- **Migrations/** – EF Core migrations

This structure ensures a **clear separation of concerns**, making the codebase easier to maintain and test.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core 8** – Web API framework
- **Entity Framework Core** – ORM for PostgreSQL
- **PostgreSQL** – Relational database
- **Swashbuckle / Swagger** – Interactive API documentation
- **Onion Architecture** – Layered architecture pattern
- **DTOs & AutoMapper** – For clean API models and mapping between layers

---

## Notes

- **GUID IDs** are auto-generated for all entities.
- **DTOs** are used to avoid exposing database entities directly to the client.
- **Onion Architecture** separates core business logic from infrastructure and presentation layers.
- **Database schema** uses `snake_case` for PostgreSQL compatibility.
- **Swagger UI** is fully integrated for testing all CRUD endpoints.

## Installation Steps

Follow these steps to get the Learning Management System running locally:

1. **Clone the repository**  
   Clone the project to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muradxanyann/LearningManagementSystem.git
   cd LearningManagementSystem
   
2. **Update the database connection**
   Open appsettings.json and set your PostgreSQL connection string:
    
    ```bash
      "ConnectionStrings": {
           "DefaultConnection": "Host=localhost;Database=LMSDb;Username=postgres;Password=yourpassword"
      }

3. **Apply Entity Framework Core migrations**
      Run the following commands to create the database schema and tables:

    ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   dotnet run
   
5.Access Swagger UI
